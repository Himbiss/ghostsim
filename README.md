ghostsim
========

This is a programming simulator
It provides a Editor in which the user can write a java program that controls Boo,
the ghost from Super Mario. Boo can be guided through a territory with obstacles and Items.
The user can modify the territory and save it for future use. The aim of this program is to 
give students who don't know any knowledge in programming
the possibility to learn the basic concepts of programming.
This program was built during the course "Fortgeschrittene Java-Technologien" in 2014 and is heavily 
based on the Hamster Simulator by Dr.-Ing. Dietrich Boles (http://www.java-hamster-modell.de/simulator.html)
